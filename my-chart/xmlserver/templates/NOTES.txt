{{- include "sch.config.init" (list . "xmlserver.sch.chart.config.values") -}}

The XML Server is not intended to be accessed from outside the cluster.

The following properties must be set in the SPM database to point at the ClusterIP service in front of the XML Server pods:

- curam.xmlserver.host: {{ include "sch.names.fullName" (list .) }}
- curam.xmlserver.port: {{ .Values.serverPort }}

The service will balance SPM print requests across any replicas of the XML server automatically.
