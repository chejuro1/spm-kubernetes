{{- include "sch.config.init" (list . "batch.sch.chart.config.values") }}

The following batch programs have been scheduled:

{{- range $progID, $prog := .Values.programs }}
Program ID: {{ $progID }}
Program Details:
  {{- toYaml $prog | nindent 2 }}
{{ end }}

To schedule additional programs, add a key under 'programs' with the following structure:

  programID:
    schedule:     Cron expression when the batch program should run
    className:    Java class for the Batch batch process (-Dbatch.program=)
    parameters:   Parameters, if any, to be passed to the batch process (-Dbatch.parameters=)
    username:     Username to use for the execution of the batch process (-Dbatch.username=)

Any program may also override the following properties, by specifying a key with the same name and syntax:

  javaOptions:                  Java options to be specified via ANT_OPTS
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit:   Number of successful job executions to keep
  backoffLimit:                 Number of attempts to run a batch job, in case of failure
  concurrencyPolicy:            Specifies how to treat concurrent executions of a Job (Allow|Forbid|Replace)
  resources:                    CPU and Memory requests and limits
